Dynamic Form Generator
This project consists of a dynamic form generator using HTML and JavaScript. Users can easily configure various form fields through a provided script and incorporate it into their web applications.

Getting Started
To integrate this dynamic form generator into your project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/integration-tech/interface.git

Open the project directory: cd your-repo

Include the provided script directly in your HTML document:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Dynamic Form Generator</title>
    <style>
        /* Include the styles from the script here */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="form"></div>

    <script>
        // Include the combined script here
        function loadFormUI() {
            // ... (rest of the code)
        }

        function setFormConfiguration({ apiname, name }) {
            // ... (rest of the code)
        }

        window.form = {};
        window.form.setFormConfiguration = setFormConfiguration;

        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("api: " + form.apiname);
            console.log("name: " + form.name);
        }, 1000);

        loadFormUI();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Configure the form by updating the formConfig array in the script and set the configuration using:

html
Copy code
<script>
    form.setFormConfiguration({
        apiname: "ram",
        name: "ravan"
    });
</script>
Customize the apiname and name parameters as needed.

Form Configuration
The form can be configured with various field types and options. Modify the formConfig array in the combined script file (script tag in the HTML) to customize the form fields.

Example configuration:

javascript
Copy code
const formConfig = [
    { "name": "nameField", "type": "text", "placeholder": "Enter your name" },
    // ... other field configurations ...
];
Usage
To use the dynamic form generator, call the loadFormUI() function, which will generate and display the form in the specified HTML container.

html
Copy code
<script>
    loadFormUI();
</script>
